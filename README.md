ArchE is an architecture modeling tool tailored for software developers and electrical/electronic (E/E) architects engaged in the automotive sector. It enables the creation of precise models that integrate both software and hardware components, detailing their interfaces, behaviors, and resource allocations. This holistic approach ensures a unified and consistent view of the vehicle's architecture, facilitating efficient development and integration. Built upon JetBrains' Meta Programming System (MPS), ArchE allows for the creation of domain-specific languages (DSLs), enabling users to define processes directly as rules. By consolidating various architectural models—spanning system, software, security, and more—into a single platform, ArchE eliminates redundancy and inconsistency, promoting a cohesive development environment.

In the rapidly evolving automotive industry, the complexity of software and hardware architectures has surged, demanding advanced tools to streamline development. Recognizing the absence of a tailored solution, CARIAD developed ArchE—a custom-built architecture tool designed to accelerate and optimize the development of complex automotive systems. With this repository, CARIAD is step-by-step open-sourcing parts of developed Domain Specific Languages.
